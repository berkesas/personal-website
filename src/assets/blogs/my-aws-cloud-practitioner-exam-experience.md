## Introduction

Recently, I prepared for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam and successfully passed it. Here are the key lessons I learned from this experience. There is a wealth of information available online about this certification, and many individuals have generously shared their own preparation journeys and insights into obtaining the certification. 

In this blog post, I will share my personal experience and the lessons I have gained. This is not merely a recounting of a significant achievement. It is the easiest AWS exam and many people pass the exam in their first attempt. Neither is it a review of an AWS product. Instead, it represents my personal perspective on this concept.

## What is AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification?

**AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification** is a foundational certification from AWS. According to its [official website](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1) it validates foudnational, high-level understanding of AWS cloud, services, and terminology. AWS states that this certification serves as an excellent starting point for individuals without prior IT or cloud experience who are transitioning to a career in the cloud, as well as for those looking to establish a solid foundation in cloud literacy. In addition to the "Foundational" level, AWS also offers certifications at the "Associate," "Professional," and "Specialty" levels.

They are described as follows:

- Foundational - knowledge-based certification for foundational understanding of AWS Cloud
- Associate - role-based certifications to acquire knowledge and skills, build credibility as an AWS Cloud Professional
- Professional - role-based certifications for advanced skills and knowledge
- Specialty - for diving deeper and becoming a trusted expert to your stakeholders

Simply put, at the "Foundational" level, you acquire theoretical knowledge; at the "Associate" level, you gain applied skills; at the "Professional" level, you develop advanced skills; and at the "Specialty" level, you achieve deep expertise.

## Is "Foundational" certification a good place to start?

Before addressing this question I want to explain why I chose AWS, instead of Azure, GCP. After conducting some research, I discovered that AWS is currently the largest cloud provider and a leader in cloud computing services. While this landscape could evolve over time, that's the current state of affairs. Nonetheless, I do keep open the possibility of pursuing Azure or GCP certifications in the future.

AWS suggests that you don't need to do "Foundational" certification if you have IT experience. Although I have been programming since my high school years and I have significant amount of IT knowledge I decided to take this certification path.

Many individuals, particularly those already employed, often question the value of certifications. They argue that employers prioritize practical skills and a strong portfolio over formal credentials. However, for newcomers entering the field, acquiring the skills that appeal to potential employers must begin somewhere. Learning skills without a structured approach or building a portfolio from scratch can be challenging. Therefore, I believe structured learning is more beneficial in the long run compared to solely relying on online tutorials to showcase skills.

Following tutorials may give the impression of learning, but often results in mere duplication of existing knowledge limited to what's covered in those tutorials. This is why understanding concepts, theories, and approaches from original sources and documentation is crucial. It provides a deeper understanding and broader foundation upon which to build practical skills and a robust portfolio.

Returning to the original question, there were several reasons for my decision:

- Firstly, I felt that my knowledge of cloud technologies was not sufficient for the level of expertise I aimed to achieve. Upon reviewing the materials, I quickly realized that despite its "Foundational" label, the concepts were intricate and the questions were not straightforward; they didn't have obvious answers.
- Secondly, I didn't necessarily need the certification itself. No employer required it, nor was there a specific job prospect that demanded it. My primary interest lay in acquiring the knowledge itself. I wasn't motivated solely to pass the exam and simply "tick the box."
- Thirdly, I am committed to pursuing higher-level certifications such as "Associate" and "Professional" in the future. Therefore, I had no doubts that the foundational concepts I learned would benefit me. In essence, preparing for the Foundational level meant I was already laying the groundwork for the levels above, without wasting mental energy.
- Fourthly, drawing from my understanding of learning theory, I know that attempting to tackle a level for which you're not adequately prepared does not foster effective learning. For those curious about this concept, it aligns with [Lev Vygotsky's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Vygotsky) theory of the ["zone of proximal development"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development). I've experienced the frustration of trying to grasp new concepts without a solid grasp of the basics, and I've decided to avoid that struggle going forward.

## The resources I used

When I finished the exam, my perspective on the resources needed for preparation changed significantly. Initially, I believed that a comprehensive approach involving multiple sources, third-party providers, and books on AWS cloud would be beneficial. While these can be helpful, they are not necessary. The only resource you need to prepare for AWS certifications is [AWS Training and Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/training/?nc2=sb_tc). It offers more than enough original material to adequately prepare for the exam. There is no need for additional third-party services, mock exams, or books.

AWS offers Basic courses that are free and Enhanced courses that require a subscription. I subscribed out of curiosity to see the difference, but I found that the free version provides ample material. So, don’t worry if you can't access the paid content; you’re not missing out on anything crucial. The most important learning materials are free and publicly available.

I've read blogs where some exam-takers used Udemy courses and other specialized AWS trainings. In my opinion, these additional resources aren’t necessary. I plan to pursue higher-level certifications and will test my hypothesis of using only AWS resources for preparation. I’ll report my findings on my blog.

## Types of learning resources

AWS offers text-based learning materials, such as whitepapers, and engaging, interactive learning simulations like AWS Cloud Quest. Be warned—it can be addictive! [AWS Cloud Quest](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-cloud-quest/) is a 3D game designed for learning AWS Cloud. Additionally, AWS provides traditional lessons that combine video lectures, multiple-choice questions, and supplementary materials. They also offer hands-on labs where you can complete exercises to learn how to build solutions or use specific features.

</figure>

All of these resources are directly beneficial for exam preparation. I found that every part of the lessons was useful. During the actual exam, I felt that the content was well-aligned with the teaching materials developed by AWS.

It's important to assess your readiness before the exam. You can reschedule twice if necessary. Before taking the exam, I tried two practice exams on the AWS platform, scoring 81% on one and 86% on the other. Since the passing grade is 70%, I felt confident enough to take the actual test without rescheduling.

However, if I had scored only 70% on the practice exams, I wouldn't have been as confident about my readiness. Taking an exam at home in a relaxed environment is different from taking the official exam under stress. To gauge your readiness, aim for at least a 5% buffer above the passing grade. If you're scoring below 75%, you might be risking your money.

The allocated time for the exam was sufficient for me. You have 90 minutes for 65 questions, and if you're quick, you can finish in 30 minutes. However, this depends on your proficiency in English. Non-native speakers can request an extension. Although I am not a native speaker, I didn't feel the need for an extension. For higher-level certifications, I might consider using that option.

## The level of difficulty and content coverage

As a foundational-level exam, the questions are not too difficult and align with what you would expect. I didn’t encounter any ‘tricky’ questions; if you know the material, you can answer confidently. Everything is transparent, and you are provided with a clear exam guide and reference materials to prepare.

The questions are multiple-choice, with some requiring one, two, or occasionally three correct answers. I found the one-correct-choice questions to be easier. There are no questions which require you to do a lab assignment.

The following knowledge areas are covered in the exam:

- AWS Cloud concepts
- Security and compliance in the AWS Cloud
- Core AWS services
- Economics of the AWS Cloud

One big theme in the exam is "migrating to AWS cloud." There are many questions about the benefits of cloud computing and migrating to the cloud. At times, it can feel like this is more about economics than cloud technology. But hey, we live in a market society. It's important to put everything in sound economic foundations. Understanding the economic motivation for moving to the cloud is as important as understanding the technical steps for the migration.

On the flip side, I learned a lot about system design and software architecture concepts that apply beyond the AWS domain. If I were to switch to Azure or GCP, I expect it would be easy for me to understand their systems. I’d just need to learn the specific terms they use for the same cloud computing concepts.

As paradoxical as it may sound, the more I learned about AWS, the better I understood how other cloud platforms might work. Many concepts and skills are transferable. I know this from my own experience of learning [Angular](https://angular.dev) after [React](https://react.dev), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) after [Symfony](https://symfony.com/).

## How would I prepare if I were to do it again?

I would use the following sequence if I were to prepare for the exam again. You may change the sequence to make it more interactive.

1. Review all [AWS Certifications exams](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/exams/). Especially review AWS Certification paths and understand how everything links together and how it connects to your career objectives.
2. Review the exam guide by visiting the [respective page](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/).
3. Study Official Practice Question Set to see sample questions asked in the exam.
4. Do Exam Prep Standard Course, and Enhanced Course if you can pay.
5. Try to do lab exercises with a real AWS account (your own or provided by AWS). It is important to visualize the services.
6. Review AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) Reference Guide. This is a concise summary of important things.
7. Study AWS Well-Architected Framework and AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) very carefully.
8. Study AWS Whitepaper Overview of Amazon Web Services. This is important because there are many questions which ask what service delivers which functionality.
9. Do [AWS Cloud Quest](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-cloud-quest/) and [AWS Escape Room: Exam Prep for AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/17373/aws-escape-room-for-exam-prep-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02)
10. Check your readiness by taking the Official Practice Exam.

## Special tips

Some service names are similar to each other and can be misleading. Here are a few examples, though there are many more.

- Amazon Connect (support service) - Amazon Direct Connect (dedicated Internet connection)
- AWS Cost Explorer - AWS Cost and Usage Report
- CloudWatch (monitoring metrics) - CloudTrail (monitoring user activities)
- GuardDuty (threat detection) - Detective (analyze suspicious activities) - Inspector (vulnerability management)

The best way to remember the meanings of these similar-sounding names might be to try using them in practice. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't consistently recall the differences, especially between GuardDuty, Detective, and Inspector. So, find a method that works best for you. Alternatively, you could prepare yourself to potentially answer these incorrectly while focusing on getting all other questions right.

## The exam experience itself

You have the option to take the exam at home, but I opted to test at a Pearson Vue testing center. I was not sure if it was Celsius or Fahrenheit but it was a hot Boston summer day. I took the commuter rail and the red line. I reached the test center 20 minutes before the test. I had a good chat with the test site administrator about cloud technology. Everything worked well for me.

Depending on your circumstances, deciding where to take the exam can be significant. You need a quiet environment to concentrate on answering the questions. While an official test center doesn't guarantee absolute quiet, it's a consideration. You never know the actual conditions at the exam venue — whether the windows provide sound isolation or if there's nearby construction on the day of your test. This aspect didn't affect my experience this time, but I can see how it might make it difficult to read and focus on the questions.

## Key takeaways

To summarize, here are my suggestions:

- View the exam as a tool for learning rather than just a requirement to check off.
- Take the time to understand concepts thoroughly instead of rushing through the materials.
- Focus on AWS official resources—they are of good quality and comprehensive.
- Engage in hands-on exercises; learning solely from reading can be challenging.
- Assess your readiness thoroughly before the exam and reschedule if necessary.
- Ensure you are well-prepared for the logistics of exam day.
