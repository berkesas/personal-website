## How am I using Coursera?

I’ve been leveraging [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) to boost my coding skills since 2022. I opted for the Coursera Plus subscription, and it’s been a fantastic resource. With Coursera Plus, I have access to an abundance of resources—far more than I could ever hope to explore. Before settling on Coursera, I conducted some research and considered Udemy and edX as alternatives. Both platforms received high praise, but Coursera’s Plus package, with its all-access approach as opposed to the per-course payment model of Udemy and edX, was the deciding factor for me.

## Perceptions of Coursera

There’s no shortage of blogs and YouTube videos weighing the pros and cons of Coursera. Moreover, there’s a prevalent belief that certificates from platforms like Coursera don’t carry much weight in the job market. Searching for “Is Coursera worth it” will bring up a variety of these viewpoints. Initially, such skepticism did dampen my enthusiasm. However, after engaging with more courses on Coursera, I’ve realized that, for my personal growth, Coursera has been incredibly beneficial.

## Are there quality courses on Coursera?

Absolutely, the answer is a resounding Yes. My journey through various courses has led me to discover three tiers of quality offerings. Firstly, there are courses crafted by industry giants like Google, Meta, Amazon, and IBM. The caliber of these courses mirrors the prestige of the companies that offer them. I’ve taken several of these courses and have gained substantial knowledge from them. 

Secondly, there are offerings from reputable universities. Take, for instance, the Software Product Management Specialization by the University of Alberta. Despite not being very familiar with this institution, I found the course content and its delivery to be exceptional. 

Lastly, there are courses that have significantly enhanced my learning due to the excellence of the professors. Some of my favorites were the ‘Python for Everybody Specialization’ by Charles Russell Severance of the University of Michigan, ‘Algebra: Elementary to Advanced Specialization’ by Joseph W. Cutrone of Johns Hopkins University, and the ‘Full-Stack Web Development with React Specialization’ by Jogesh K. Muppala of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Financial Accounting from Brian Bushee of Wharton School was fun. The way these educators convey their material made me feel as though I was right there in their classroom. While there are numerous other commendable courses, these, in particular, stood out to me.

## Which areas need improvement?

Coursera is fundamentally a platform—a tool for teaching and learning. Its effectiveness hinges on how we, as users, choose to utilize it. One aspect that falls short on Coursera is the Discussions feature. The forums are often filled with less-than-helpful entries, with some students merely posting ‘ok’ or ‘good,’ even though participation isn’t mandatory. This diminishes the peer-learning experience, which seems to be more of a social issue than a technical one.

Another facet that requires attention is the responsiveness to queries. Occasionally, assignments come with errors or issues, and obtaining support in these instances is rare, if not outright impossible. Recognizing these limitations, I’ve recalibrated my expectations and have continued my learning journey.

Lastly, there’s an imbalance in the workload distribution in certain courses. Sometimes, the instructional material is too simplistic compared to the complexity of the assignments, or vice versa. This discrepancy suggests that course creators may not have devoted sufficient consideration to the pedagogical balance of the coursework.

## Why do I think it is still good?

There are several features on Coursera that I haven’t utilized, but here are the aspects I really appreciate:

##### User-interface

The UI is intuitive, user-friendly, and efficient. It has consistently served me well. Completed modules are indicated by a green checkmark icon, which is a handy way to track progress.

##### Presentation of material

The learning materials are segmented into weeks or modules, thoughtfully arranged in a logical sequence that builds on previously acquired knowledge.

##### Good videos

The platform offers high-quality videos for visual learners, complete with transcriptions for added convenience.

##### Diversity of approaches

Coursera celebrates the uniqueness of both learners and educators. The courses are distinctively crafted, fostering a varied and engaging learning experience that keeps me motivated.

##### Quality of learning materials

I’ve been impressed with the material in many courses, rating them from satisfactory to excellent. A significant number of these courses are developed by renowned universities and esteemed professors.

## What worked well for me?

With Coursera, you’re billed for the duration of your subscription, which allows you the flexibility to take as many courses as you’d like, depending on your learning pace and schedule.

I chose to tackle multiple courses simultaneously for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I wanted to avoid monotony by engaging with various subjects, much like a traditional university semester where you study different but related courses.

Secondly, I recognized that some courses could be challenging, and their assignments daunting. To give my mind a breather, I opted to shift my focus to other subjects instead of hitting a wall with one difficult problem, thus keeping the learning process active.

Nevertheless, it’s crucial to maintain a manageable course load. I found that enrolling in more than three or four courses at once was counterproductive, as it hindered my progress.

I approached Coursera’s offerings as foundational stepping stones into new areas of knowledge. I understood that course completion alone wouldn’t render me an expert, but it did provide me with the essential skills and understanding to determine my future learning trajectory.

## Conclusion

Software development is an intricate field that demands dedication. To master it, a well-organized approach to learning is essential. Coursera has offered me this framework, and I’m actively expanding my skills through its courses.
