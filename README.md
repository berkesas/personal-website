# Personal website

## About

Repo for my personal website. If you want to create your own website fast, you can use it. It is very opinionated and experimental. I am intentionally not using a database and trying to do it with .json files. This is mainly for people who can actually code at least a little bit.

## Tech used

- Angular - pre-rendering, no SSR
- Manually edited markdown files
- Marked.js markdown parser

## Current features

- Blogs from markdown files
- Pages from markdown files
- Filter blogs

## Todo list

- Keep cleaning
- Add tests
- Add personal tweet/status update feature
- Filter blogs by tags
- Remove hardcoded data to .env files

## Strategic goal

- Clean code
- Modularity
